Obviously the solution will end up being slower the larger the xml files get.
This could be improved by using LINQ to XML to join the two XML files.
However i think that the XML files are poorly contrusted, ie: the Id fields should be used as
attributes in the Event and Company tags. This would allow the files to easily be joined
using LINQ to XML.
In order to get line numbers in the error messages i would have needed to have implemented
the XMLReader instead of using XPath.
